Due to file size limitations (over 25 MB), I was unable to directly upload the data image set. Instead, I have provided an external link to access the complete dataset. This dataset contains high-resolution chest X-ray images used for pneumonia detection. The images are crucial for training and evaluating the performance of different deep learning models, such as CNN, VGG16, ResNet, and Inception. Each image in the dataset is labeled to indicate whether pneumonia is present, allowing for supervised learning and performance comparison among the models.
The dataset plays a central role in my project, as the quality and variety of the images significantly influence the model accuracy and generalizability. Proper preprocessing and augmentation techniques are applied to this dataset to improve model performance and handle class imbalance.
